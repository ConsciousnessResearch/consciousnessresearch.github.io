The **Consciousness Research Centre** theory of consciousness—known as Dharmasār, the Essence of Dharma—is a breakthrough in understanding consciousness in spiritual thought and practice. It is comparable in importance, scope and impact to Einstein’s discovery of Relativity. This is no exaggeration, for the Essence of Dharma **resolves all apparent contradictions** between stages of the spiritual Path, and among the various religious sects and organizations, by providing an extremely broad **ontological view** and analysis of the ancient Vedic theory of consciousness, easily verifiable by anyone and capable of supporting all spiritual and religious views.

**Dev Priyānanda Svāmī Bhagavān**, founder of Consciousness Research Centre, is a senior independent *sannyāsī* in the South Indian Śākta line. While researching Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on *Vedānta-sūtra* trying to understand his personal enlightenment experience, he fortuitously rediscovered an ancient holistic framework for spiritual life based on the four states of consciousness: Dharmasār, the ancient Vedic theory of consciousness.

**The CRC Video Series** is a [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@Gnowly108) and [online archive](https://archive.org/details/dharmasar-essence-of-dharma?tab=collection) with over 1,700 videos analyzing a broad range of spiritual traditions in the light of the Esoteric Teaching of **Dharmasār**—the Essence of Dharma. It is structured according to the types, states and stages of development of consciousness. This document describes and explains the inner organization and structure of the Teaching according to the seven *cakras* and four states of consciousness.

***Root Ontology***

All perception is based on consciousness. There are four states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, deep sleep and the fourth, *turīya* also called God, Brahman, Nirvāṇa, Self-realization, Enlightenment etc.

The **root ontology** of **Consciousness Research Centre** is shown here:

![Untitled](CRC%20Video%20Series%20cad46edf801d4ea2884619f258024994/Untitled.png)

The classification of the videos series is based on the level of **development of consciousness** through the *yoga* system, and the *cakras* that represent the center of awareness and support for that consciousness:

![Untitled](CRC%20Video%20Series%20cad46edf801d4ea2884619f258024994/Untitled%201.png)

The seven *cakras* are divided into **four groups**. The groups are the basis of the ***catur-darśanam*** (four views of reality). The views are expressions of the **four states of consciousness**: *jagrat, svapna, suṣupti* and *turīya*. The practices related to the views and states of consciousness are the **four principal *yogas**: karma, bhakti, rāja* and *jñāna*.

The CRC **videos and courses are similarly divided into **four groups**, plus **Introductory** and **Uncategorized** sections. The groups contain videos and courses relevant to the *cakras* in each group. The student is expected to **begin with the Introductory section** and progress gradually through the four levels of consciousness as his practice develops. This document **lists** and **explains** all the categories.

## **Introductory**

The videos in the **Introductory** section are preliminary materials, required prerequisites for the course series in the following sections. Our system of **ontological self-learning** leverages the background knowledge given in these courses to produce extraordinary results. Since **meaning is determined by context**, the ontological context established in the Introductory courses enhances the meaning of the other courses. And since **meaning** and **value** are closely **related**, this **greatly increases** their value. By completing the **Introductory** courses you become a fully qualified **CRC Researcher**. Then you can consult with your Senior Researcher to create a **Personal Learning Plan** to chart your route through the more advanced courses.

## ***Jagrat* | *Dvaita-vāda* | *Karma-yoga***

The courses in the ***Dvaita-vāda* Section** are based on *jagrat* consciousness, the dualistic view of the phenomenal world and empirical individual self as real. This is the domain of taking care of the body, care for the world, and the effort to establish an independent individuality. But because this empirical self is temporary and illusory, this effort only leads to **suffering**. Thus people turn to sectarian religion for relief of suffering, not realizing that they themselves are the architects of their fate. However, engaging in care of health, financial and psychological well-being, good education, charity and other gifts, regular performance of the religious rituals of *karma-yoga* gradually purify beings through accumulation of pious *karma* (*puñya*). Thus these courses apply to the first two *cakras*.

### ****1. *Mūlādhāra-cakra***

The courses in this section are about the **root or sex cakra**. Sex energy supports and animates the whole body. The Kuṇḍalinī-Śakti resides here, coiled like a snake. The yoga process is a series of techniques intended to raise the Kuṇḍalinī up the *suśumna* spinal channel until She unites with Śiva in the crown *cakra*. This is enlightenment or Self-realization. Attaining complete Self-realization requires the **full energy of the human being**, which resides in the root or sex *chakra*. Thus complete development or evolution of the sex energy is required to attain the highest energy levels.

### ****2. *Svādhiṣṭhāna-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the **sex and energy-storage *cakras***. Vital energy—*prāṇa*, Chi, Ki or Qi—is life itself. This energy is stored in the second *cakra*, just below the navel. Techniques like *prāṇāyama* and Qigong collect and concentrate the vital energy. Increasing and optimizing the vital energy is required for robust health and success in meditation.

## ***Svapna* | *Viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda* | *Bhakti-yoga***

In this section are courses based on limited or conditioned nonduality: ***viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda***. In this view, one knows intellectually that ultimate reality is nondual, and aspires to reach it in the future. Meanwhile, one still experiences the phenomenal world and identifies with the empirical self. The practice in this stage is *bhakti-yoga:* spontaneous devotional service to one of the forms of the Godhead, according to one’s taste. This service is built on the foundation of *karma-yoga* established in the previous stage.

### ****3. *Maṇipūraka-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the **movement or solar plexus cakra**. Everyone needs movement to stay healthy and alive. Movement and breath distribute energy throughout the body. So everyone should cultivate some exercise form: *haṭha-yoga*, Tai-chi, dance, swimming. Beyond this, in spiritual life there are many activities that need to be performed to prepare for the more advanced stages. These are called *karma-yoga*, and are done with the movement *cakra* in harmony with a higher purpose.

### ****4. *Anāhata-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the **heart *cakra*** and the practice of *bhakti-yoga*. When sufficient *puñya* or good *karma* is accumulated by practice of the rituals and
duties of *karma-yoga*, one gradually develops spontaneous attraction toward the object of one’s worship. This is experienced as a very sweet and satisfying emotional taste (*bhāva* or *rasa*). This taste gradually develops to the stage of ecstatic love (*prema*).

## ***Suṣupti* | *Vivartha-vāda* | *Rāja-yoga***

In this section you will find courses based on ***vivartha-vāda**:* the view that duality is an illusion or appearance. The practice of deep meditation, *rāja-yoga*, is emptying the mind of all thoughts to perceive the essence: *nibbāna* (*nirvāṇa*), the transcendental Self or Brahman. The Buddha’s teaching, with its stress on meditation and emptiness, fits nicely into this category.

****5. *Viśuddhi-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the throat *cakra*. Transcendental sound vibration —*mantras*, scriptural readings and recitations, prayer and spontaneous expressions of bliss and ecstasy—are important aspects of the spiritual Path. Here you find the powerful confidential *mantras* of the Śrī Vidyā that give deep emotional satisfaction, transcendental knowledge, bliss and Self-realization.

### **6. *Ājñā-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the ***ajña*** (forehead) **cakra**. The main activity in this stage is meditation: *rāja-yoga*. When *bhakti-yoga* ripens and reaches completion, meditation—fixing the mind on a single thought—arises spontaneously. There is an orderly progression of progressively abstract states, called in the Buddha’s teaching the *jhānas*, leading to the four Path Realizations. This Path leads one on (*opanāyaka*) to realization of emptiness (*śūnyatā*).

## ***Turīya* | *Ajata-vāda* | *Jñāna-yoga***

This section has courses based on ***ajata-vāda**:* the view that only Brahman is real, and the phenomenal world and empirical self do not exist. This view is realized through *jñāṇa-yoga*, nondual pure awareness of the primordial Self (Brahman).

### ****7. *Sahasrāra-cakra***

This section contains courses and videos about the ***sahasrāra*** (crown) ***cakra***. This is the seat of pure awareness (Śiva). It is also the source of spiritual ecstasy, the full taste for which everyone is hankering. Spiritual pleasure is without beginning or end. In ordinary consciousness we cover it with various forms of suffering. When this suffering is gradually removed through the *yoga* process, our natural happiness and bliss shine forth. This is the perfection of life.
