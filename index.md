# Welcome to Consciousness Research Centre (CRC)

![CRC Logo](art/CRCLogoSmall.png)

A living archive of Vedic philosophy, spiritual practice, and reflections on the Self.

**Consciousness Research Centre** provides postgraduate-level online and IRL seminars exploring the Upaniṣads, the Buddha’s teachings, yoga, tantra, Vedic astrology, and the lived experience of the nondual Self—a lifetime of spiritual experience and wisdom. This is not mere *vidyā* (scholarship); everything taught here has been personally studied, practiced and realized by the author.
