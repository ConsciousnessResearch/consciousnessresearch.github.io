**Integrity** is based on the principle of **truthfulness**: keeping one’s word. Integrity has to be based on something **real**; thus integrity cannot refer to a corporation, religion, nation-state or other **abstraction**. Integrity is meaningful only in the context of an **individual**: ‘a man or woman of integrity.’ Integrity is how to live with a **clean conscience**.

_Āya Bhuwan:_ may you live long! Welcome to **Being Integrity**. This is going to be a series—quite an extensive series, I think—about **integrity and the Buddha’s teaching**.

Now integrity is based on **truthfulness**. We hear these days a lot of talk about ‘integrity in business’. But this is actually an **oxymoron**. For those of you who aren’t on good terms with your dictionary, an oxymoron means a self-contradictory statement, like **military intelligence** or **integrity in business**.

Because what’s the first thing you do when you start a business? You file a **fictitious name statement** and then you incorporate, and your incorporation is simply some **words on paper** and signed by a few people. And then suddenly you have this entity that has all the rights of a person! Of course a corporation isn’t a person; it’s a **lie**, and so is the name. The whole thing is a **fabrication**.

So in that context **how can you have any integrity**? It’s just self-contradictory, oxymoronic to have integrity in the context of a corporation. It’s just impossible.

Of course one can have personal integrity himself. But then to work for a corporation is definitely a breach of personal integrity, because that means you’re recognizing an entity that’s fictitious! Anyway, so we’re not going to talk about integrity in the context of business and we’re not going to talk about it in the context of religion either.

Because religion is also a **fabrication**. You might say well you’re a monkey or in the ‘buddhist’ religion, but actually there is no such thing as ‘buddhism’. As another ‘buddhist’ monk, Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu has kindly pointed out, that religions are also **fabrications**. They are also **abstractions**; they also have **no real physical existence**. They’re just **information**, they’re just **software**. So what to speak of talking about corporate context, it’s **meaningless** to talk about integrity in a **religious context** as well.

What **is** meaningful, however, is to talk about a **man** of integrity, a **person** of integrity; and Buddha used the word _sappurisā_. _Sappurisā_ is a combination of _sat_ and _purisā._ _Sat_ means **truthful** or actually, eternally existing, and eternal is real being. A temporary being is only fabricated, phony being; but eternal being is real being. So that kind of man, _purisā_, who is eternal who has eternal values, eternal verities and truths, is known as a _sappurisā._

_Sappurisā_ is a man of integrity. So we’re talking here about how to transform your being into that of a _sappurisā,_ a man of integrity. Because integrity is not something you **have**—that would make it a virtue. And that would make it disposable, dispensable or changeable. But we’re talking about a type of integrity that is so deep that it’s integrated with your very being: integral integrity, wholeness; _sappurisā,_ eternal truths.

It’s based on something beyond this temporary existence, temporary being and temporary meanings. And what is that? Well, the Buddha’s teaching, of course. But there are also very specific things that we can use to measure a person’s **degree of integrity**, and we’re going to be going into this in great detail in subsequent episodes.

Being Integrity is based on the teaching of the Buddha. But **what is** the teaching of the Buddha? I already said it’s not a religion. Some people claim that it’s a philosophy, but it’s not really a philosophy either. The teaching of the Buddha is something unique. It’s something that has never existed before. It’s something that we don’t even have a word for in western languages, because it’s completely transcendent. It’s not based on the concept of God, it’s not even based on the concept of the Complete Whole of **monism** or **oneness**; it’s beyond even **that**.

So the Buddha has gone to a dimension that nobody has reached before—at least in historical times—and this is his unique contribution to the welfare of all humanity. So this teaching, the teaching of the Buddha, being beyond everything else, it doesn’t really have a proper name. The only thing you can call it is **the Dhamma**.

And _dhamma,_ as we’ve discussed in two other videos in this series, _dhamma_ is simply **what is**. Not only what **is**—the **way** it is. And not only the **way** it is, but **why** it is the way it is. This is the Buddha’s Dhamma and this is what he was teaching to his disciples. That’s going to be the basis of this entire series.

In fact it’s not even correct to call the teaching of the Buddha a spiritual path, because the Buddha makes no distinction between material and spiritual, the way to dualistic Western religions and philosophies do. For the Buddha, **what is, is**; and it’s neither material or spiritual—it’s just **what is**. It’s just **_dhamma_**_._

So the Buddha, the path of the Buddha, the teaching of the Buddha, is not really a religion, a philosophy or even a spiritual discipline. It’s something that is unique and has no equivalent in any other path. That’s why we call it simply **the Dhamma**, the **way it is**.

Now a lot of people criticize Buddhism because it has **so many rules**, or **precepts** as we like to call it. There are ten basic precepts, starting with no lying, no stealing, no killing and so on. Well, why do we have so many rules? The monks follow 227 precepts, and even those don’t really explain everything.

So there are rules because there is _karma_ or _kamma,_ as it’s called in Pāḷī. _Kamma_ is simply the result, the equal and opposite result of any action. So if I harm someone, if I hurt someone, if I steal from someone, then that’s going to come back to me, and I will suffer the **identical pain** that I have caused.

And also there’s good _kamma_ as well, but the art of creating good _kamma_ is very difficult for most Westerners, because it involves “religious” or spiritual activities, and we don’t want to believe in something. So we’re going to give a **scientific basis** for right and wrong—a scientific basis based on the theory of _kamma_ or more technically correct, **Dependent Origination** (_paṭicca-samuppāda_) as it was described by the Buddha.

The **law of _kamma_** has very scientific principles behind it—and they begin with our **intention**, and our **conception** of the world and ourselves. These form **causes**, which produce **effects**. Among those effects are **becoming**, and **being** and **birth**.

So the **birth** that we have, the **existence** that we have, the **being** that we have, is because of a **process of becoming**. And this process of becoming has certain definite laws and rules. And we can learn these, we can use them to create a more **ideal form of being** for ourselves; and in this way we can rise above the problem of _kamma_ that causes suffering and rebirth.

That’s basically the essence of the Buddha’s path. So the benefits of precepts like **mindfulness, purity, meditation** and so on… “Well, what are the benefits of these things? Can they be measured?” **Yes**, it’s a fact, they **can** be measured.

When we see a person who’s receiving the results of good _kamma,_ we want to **emulate** them; we want to **follow** them, because we see that they’re enjoying life at a **higher standard** than ours. So, how does a person get into that position? How do they get into that situation, where their _kamma_ is so good that they get the things that we want in life: love, attention, money, power, and so on—beauty, intelligence—like that.

These things are all the result of a **good birth**. And to get a good birth, one has to create the **causes** for that birth. So there’s a scientific process of creating _kamma_, and the benefits of that _kamma_ are measurable, not only in the next life but even in this one.

It’s said, for example, that ‘virtue is its own reward’. I would change that a little bit I would say, “**Integrity is its own reward**.” Integrity gives a kind of personal satisfaction that cannot be replaced by any amount of sense enjoyment. After all, sense enjoyment comes and goes. It’s nice when it happens; and when it doesn’t happen, then if we’re desiring it we’ll miss it, we’ll feel incomplete and will be consumed with the suffering of **desire**, another kind of suffering.

So by adopting the rules and regulations of the Buddha’s path, we **shield** ourselves from creating bad _kamma_, and we also open the door to creating good _kamma,_ _subha-kamma,_ or auspicious or beneficial _kamma,_ that in the future will give us **tremendous well-being** and an increase in all kinds of happiness and felicity.

So right and wrong, good and bad aren’t just **beliefs**; they’re not just morality, at least in the Buddha’s teaching. Maybe in some other teachings or other cultures they are, but in Buddhist culture all these things are based on **scientific conclusions** of the Buddha's **self-observation**.

You might say, “Well, that’s fine for the Buddha, but what about **me**?” The answer is, **you** can carry out the same observations on your own self, in your own life, and in your own time, by following the Buddha’s methods. They still work today, and they work for everyone. **Everyone** has access to a **laboratory** where they can perform the same experiments as the Buddha, and in that way verify the principles of the Buddha’s teaching that will give us the **integrity** that we seek.

We **know** you have a lot of questions. I had a lot of questions when I first came in contact with the Buddha’s teaching, and we all have a lot of questions about **integrity**. But this seminar, this series of videos, is designed to provide clear, satisfying answers to all those questions. Believe me, I had many questions come up, and I had to research all these things over a period of about two years.

It was driven by necessity. My whole life fell apart because of lack of integrity, and lack of knowledge of leadership and so on. So I had to look into these things very deeply to salvage my own sanity. Believe me, I had to research down to the bedrock, what is wrong with our lives. And the fact is, without integrity our lives just **don’t work**.

So the intention of this **Being Integrity** is not to give you a bunch of rules to follow, and then you can say, “Well, I have integrity.” That would be artificial, that would be phony: an **act**. A lot of people are doing this act right now, especially in the business world, saying, “Well I have integrity,” you know? It’s just a false front, because they’re cheating. They’re working for corporations, and corporations are **fabrications**. Their whole personality is simply a fabrication. And that’s one of the things that the Buddha teaches us.

So what we **really** want to achieve is **Being Integrity**—to have the **being** of integrity, to have the being of an **honest man**. That’s why the Buddha calls it _sappurisā_—_sat_ meaning honest and _purisā_ meaning human being—a human being in the full sense of the term. So that you don’t have to **act** like you have integrity; in fact you don’t even have to **have** integrity, because you **are** integrity; you have the **being** of integrity, and so integrity manifests **spontaneously** in everything that you **do**, in everything that you **are**.

You don’t have to **think** about it, you don’t have to follow **rules**, you don’t have to look up case studies or examples of how to behave with integrity—you simply automatically behave with integrity because you have the **being** of integrity. So how do you change your being into the being of integrity? That’s what we’re going to cover in this series.

So integrity, the **being** of integrity, is **authentic** being, **honest** being, **sincere** from the core, from the heart being. And who you are when you are being with integrity is **your authentic self**. This is an **enhanced** state of being over the typical being that most people have, where they’re trying to follow something outside of themselves: some set of moral rules or something like that.

Now you might say, “Well, there’s so many rules in Buddhism, what is that?” The rules in Buddhism are simply a way of **measuring** a person’s integrity, because we have found through long experience that if a person has integrity, if a person is **being** with integrity, they will automatically follow these rules. Because they will no longer cause harm or suffering to themselves or others.

The rules prohibit activities that cause bad _kamma_. So if you’re a person of integrity, you’re going to want to only do good _kamma,_ and not cause suffering. So you’re going to avoid those activities automatically. You don’t even have to think about it. It doesn’t become a rule for you, it becomes simply the **way you are**: your **being**. Actually it’s a **context**—a certain context. And we’re going to show you exactly how to **create** that context in this series.

Now our experience of life—human life on planet Earth—is usually that our life is broken. It’s broken in so many ways. Like for example, broken promises, broken dreams, broken hopes and aspirations, broken plans. How many times have you planned to do something with somebody and then they break their promise. They don’t show up, or they don’t do what they said they were going to do, or they don’t do it on time, or they don’t do it in the **way** that you expected them to do—and so on and so forth.

These are all **breakdowns**, these are failures: failures of **integrity**. And in our own life, how many times have we said, promised **ourselves** we’re going to **do** something, or we’re going to **be** a certain way, and that we didn’t do it? Alright. Well, I love that saying by Yoda, “There is no **try**: **do** or **not do**.” So every time you hear somebody saying, “Well, I’ll **try**…” No. That means you’re not going to do it; that means you’re not making a commitment from your **being** to **be** or **do** that thing in the way that you’re **expected** to do.

So unless a person has integrity, they’re going to try to get away with saying, “Well, I’ll try. Well I’ll, you know, try my best…” No! That’s nonsense! That’s not integrity; that’s trying to **act** like you have integrity just to please other people. But the truth will come out. So either you **have** integrity or you **don’t** have; either you **are** integrity or you’re **not** integrity.

The idea is to **be** integrity, so that your integrity is **spontaneous**. You don’t have to **think** about it, you don’t have to follow a bunch of rules in some book; you just **are** integrity and you **behave** with integrity **by nature**, spontaneously, effortlessly. That’s real integrity.

There’s also a lot of integrity issues around **leadership**. In leadership—well, there’s many different forms of leadership—but the leadership we’re talking about is the leadership, the **quality** of leadership, that makes people **automatically** want to follow. That makes people automatically enthusiastic to **participate** in whatever initiative the leader is proposing.

And so, the quality of a leader that is based on **integrity** is irresistible. People **love** a leader who has integrity, because they tell the **truth**. They actually keep their promises: they actually do what they said they were going to do, when they said they were going to do it. This is integrity—or, this is a way of **measuring** integrity. There are other measures of integrity, and we’re going to go deep into that subject in the seminar.

What makes a person have integrity? First of all they **decide**. They make the determination within themselves, “I’m going to have integrity.” And then they **adjust their being** until they actually are **being** with integrity. And the way you do that is by creating a context, and we’ll show you exactly how to do this in the series.

Now why is integrity so important? Why is integrity such a **vital** part of being human? To the extent that if you don’t have integrity, or if you don’t act with integrity, or if you’re not being with integrity, that you can’t be said to be a human being in the full sense of the term.

Well, another way of measuring integrity is by the reduction or elimination of **suffering**. A person with integrity, a person who is **being** with integrity, does not cause suffering, either for themselves or others. And if they do, they immediately **correct** it and make up the damage. That is the **nature** of a person of integrity. So a person of integrity—a _sappurisā_ in the Buddha’s language—is going to be a person whose life is **committed** to the eradication of suffering for themselves and others. And everything they do is going to be aimed at reducing or eliminating suffering in their own lives and in the lives of people around them.

So in essence, being with integrity is an **intention**: a **specific** intention to reduce or eliminate **suffering**. And that leads us to the definition of integrity that we’re going to use in our seminar.

Let me lead into this subject by reading some of the things that Buddha said about integrity.

“A person of integrity would know of [another] person of integrity: ‘This is a person of **integrity**.’ A person of integrity is endowed with **qualities** of integrity; he is a person of integrity in his **friendship**, in the way he **wills**, the way he gives **advice**, the way he **speaks**, the way he **acts**, the **views** he holds and the way in which he gives a **gift**.

“And **how** is a person of integrity endowed with qualities of integrity? There is the case where a person of integrity is endowed with conviction, conscience, concern; he is learned, with aroused persistence, unmuddled mindfulness and good discernment. This is how a **person** of integrity is endowed with **qualities** of integrity.” — [Cūḷa-puṇṇama Sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tipitaka/mn/mn.110.than.html) (MN 110)

So we’re going to analyze these statements by the Buddha, and we’re going to go into each of these qualities that he mentions, and define them very scientifically and completely, and answer any questions that you might have about what is the definition of a person of integrity.
