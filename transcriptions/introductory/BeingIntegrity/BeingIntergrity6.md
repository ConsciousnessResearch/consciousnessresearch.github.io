## Episode 6—**Transformation** Part 2

**Video link:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBDUUgNiFx4&list=PL8s1kPtHmCZI5gpsQHBcob3EXsFwcO7Si&index=7)

Hi, everyone.

Welcome to the latest episode of _Being Integrity_.

Now, you notice I'm not sitting in the studio.

I'm outside. Overlooking—well, I can see pretty much the whole south

end of the island from here.

I want to have a personal talk, like face to face chat.

And this is the crux of the issue. I've wanted to have this chat with you

since beginning the series. Actually, since beginning the whole skillful living

network series, all the videos that we've done so far

have led up to this conversation.

So this is a very important episode,

a very important conversation.

And if you get it, if you understand what I'm about to say,

it means you'll be able to transform your life radically

into the kind of existence that you really want.

And if you don't get it, well, you walk away from this

with very little.

So to increase your chances of getting it,

I think a few episodes ago I advised you

to go back and review our other series,

such as the Foundations series, _Becoming Genius_,

_Being in the World_, and _Call of the Friend_. Now, if you haven't done that, I strongly

advise you to stop the video now and go back and do it.

Here's a link to our playlist page.

And you can go back and review those videos

because we've been building up to this conversation

throughout the whole series from the beginning. You need to have a certain background, a certain **ontology**,

a way of looking at life, a mindset, or however you want

to describe it, a context that gives meaning

to this conversation that is big enough to hold that meaning,

to complete that meaning, to understand it,

to duplicate it in your own mind. Because this is the most important conversation

in the whole series. It might even be the most important conversation

in your life.

I'm serious.

So we've been studying the **process of becoming**

taught by the Buddha, **dependent origination**,

paticya samupada.

And what I'm here to tell you is that every minute of every day,

of every year of your whole life,

you have been engaged in a **process of becoming**. Paticya samupada is a natural law, a natural process,

as natural as gravity, as natural as weather. No, it doesn't always come out the way you expect,

but neither does the weather, does it? Still, it's lawful, it's natural,

and it operates every minute of every day,

everywhere for everyone.

So it's the closest thing that we can come to,

an actual absolute truth, an actual universal law of life,

the law of _kamma_.

Now, the law of _kamma_ is equal to everyone.

The rain falls on everybody.

It even falls on the ocean.

So everybody gets wet. Similarly, everybody gets _kamma_ according to their previous actions.

And this is how their **being** is shaped. This is how their **being** is determined by the fabrications,

by the consciousness, and by the _kamma_.

Buddha said there are three factors in **becoming**. _kamma_ is the field, consciousness is the seed,

and desire is the water, the moisture, the nutrient.

All three must be there for **becoming** to take place. Now, when we say that the chief quality of a person of **integrity**

is to reduce or eliminate **suffering**,

a lot of people will say, "Well, I do that.

I try to reduce **suffering**. That bottle of Scotch I drank last night was to reduce my **suffering**. That heroin that I shot up last week was to reduce my **suffering**. That guy that I aced out of a job at work was to reduce my **suffering**.

So I'm reducing **suffering**, see?

No.

No, we don't accept that. Because that kind of _kamma_, that kind of activity,

may reduce your **suffering**,

or the **suffering** of a few people around you.

Hey, I gave to Goodwill. I go on the Internet and that microlending site,

and I give ten dollars sometimes to some guy in Uganda who's raising coffee.

I'm reducing **suffering**, right?

No, wrong. Because if you use a method of reducing **suffering**

that does not ultimately eliminate **suffering** completely,

all you're doing is postponing it. It's like the difference between paying cash or credit card. You're going to have to pay the credit card eventually, plus interest.

So if you do something that reduces your **suffering** now

at the cost of increasing it in the future,

what have you done? You have simply mortgaged your future to pay for the present.

Another point.

The **being** that you have now,

are you satisfied with it?

Are you happy with it?

Let me ask you in another way, are you free from **suffering**?

No? Well, that means your **being** is not perfect, your **being** is not ideal.

Your **being** could stand some improvement. A real person of **integrity** has substantial relief from **suffering**,

to the point where they don't need intoxication,

they don't need sex life,

they don't need violence or stealing or cheating.

That's why the **Vinaya** is there.

That's why the **precepts** are there. To measure whether a person's **being** is actually up to the standard

of a person of **integrity**, a sapurisa.

So if you're not up to that standard,

then according to the Buddha you don't have **integrity**,

and you're going to be involved in **suffering**.

So you might say, "Well, I'm doing okay."

You know, somehow I got through my childhood

without **being** too crazy,

and I got through school without a major disaster,

and now I'm working,

and maybe I'm dating somebody or I'm in a relationship,

and I'm reasonably happy.

Well, good!

But how long can you expect that to last?

Seriously. Any happiness that you have through a process of conditioned **being**

is only temporary,

and it will fail.

It will let you down. That girlfriend or boyfriend will betray you sooner or later. I mean, even in the best possible case,

eventually either they're going to die or you're going to die.

And you're definitely going to die at the end.

How do you deal with that?

How do you handle that **suffering**? See, these things are called crucibles,

existential crises,

and they happen to everybody.

So you may be sailing along now, doing okay,

getting by, getting through the day or the week,

reasonably okay, without too much damage.

But at some point, something is going to break down.

I guarantee it.

I absolutely guarantee it.

And you might say, "Well, I'm smart enough to deal with that."

And so, in answer to that,

I want to tell you about something called the curse of the talented,

the curse of the intelligent. The curse of the intelligent is,

as long as things go fairly according to plan,

fairly normally,

fairly smoothly,

you can get by by using your natural talent and intelligence.

But at some point, there is going to come a day

when multiple things go wrong. You may be able to deal with one thing going wrong

or two things going wrong,

but when three or four or five things go wrong all at the same time,

nobody can deal with it.

It's beyond your natural ability. You need some method to approach this problem,

because at that point, you're going to want to change your **being**.

Now, this is how it works. If you watched our video on the root sequence,

which I sure hope you did,

the root sequence describes how we create our eye,

how we create our identity,

how we create our self,

and when that self is born,

other people see us as that self.

And then we go through life until one day,

something happens that invalidates that identity,

that breaks the premise on which that ego is based,

that destroys that eye.

And then we feel death.

We feel the **cessation** of that particular identity.

And so what most of us do is that we stop feeding that identity

and we go and create a new one.

So that's fine as long as it's just one thing going wrong,

as long as it's just one problem in validating that identity.

But what happens when simultaneous things go wrong all over the map?

The whole board lights up red.

What do we do? Maybe you've escaped it so far,

and you've been able to get by on your natural ability,

your intelligence, and your talent.

Well, congratulations, that's great.

But mark my words, there's going to come a day

when you have existential crisis,

when you're thrown into the cauldron,

into the frying pan.

And if you try to get out of it by creating yet another new **being**

on the same premise,

it's just like going from the frying pan into the fire. You're going to find yourself in serious, serious trouble,

with no way out.

I'm going to tell you my story,

how I got this knowledge. I was a senior disciple of a very famous spiritual teacher in India,

and I had even become a guru,

and I had ashrams and disciples and followers all over the world.

But slowly I began to develop doubts. The deeper I researched into my tradition,

the more it seemed like it was just a fabrication,

it was just imagination.

It was just a visualization based on nothing. This reached a climax,

where all of a sudden it was revealed to me

that my guru, my spiritual master,

had actually sold out all of his disciples and his entire organization

to, let's say, an outside agency, if you follow my drift.

So the success that we all attributed to his following,

strictly some ancient teaching,

that was somehow approved by God, evaporated,

and the raw fact of the matter came out that he had backing,

he had secret money coming in from very high sources. This was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back for me.

And I was feeling a lot of anxiety because of my doubts

and because of this new information coming out,

very confidentially, it still isn't public.

So I felt that I had to quit **being** guru. I had to leave my disciples to do whatever they felt was necessary,

and I had to pretty much wipe the slate clean and start all over again

to figure out what is the meaning of life and the whole thing. Another way to say it is, "My board went red."

Everything lit up with problems.

There was no easy way out.

In fact, there was no way out at all.

That's how it appeared at the time anyway. There was no way out of that situation with the **being** that I had.

That I had worked almost 50 years really to create. That **being** was finished, that **being** was dead, it was the end of the road.

And so I went off on my own,

and I tried very hard to start a new **being**,

but it was more or less based on the same principles,

and it failed.

It failed again and again.

And finally I said, "Okay, I am going to have to research

my core understandings of life

in order to understand what went wrong and how I can fix it."

So I started looking into everything, **integrity**, **leadership**, **ontology**, philosophy,

existentialism, all things that my instinct told me had some bearing on the situation.

And after more than a year of intensive research,

and I am talking about sweating it,

my life was on the line,

my reason for **being** was up for grabs.

Was I going to go back to **being** an ordinary person?

Was I going to join another spiritual group?

Was I going to just become an atheist or an agnostic?

Was I going to change my identity?

Was I going to start my life all over again?

What was I going to do?

I was 64 years old when this happened.

So I think a lot of people would have just quit,

maybe even committed suicide.

It was that bad.

It was really bad. It felt like dying every day for months

until I started to get a handle on what was wrong. What was wrong was a lack of **integrity**,

a lack of **integrity** in my teachers,

a lack of **integrity** in the society,

a lack of **integrity** in myself,

a lack of **integrity** in my followers,

in the scriptures that we followed,

in the process we were trying to implement,

and so on and so on and so forth.

Lack of **integrity**.

Well, okay, that was the cause,

but then what's the cure?

So I started researching further. Long story short, I found myself substantially in agreement

with the teaching of the Buddha.

So I went to Thailand to learn Buddhism,

to learn meditation specifically.

And within a few weeks of trying the Buddha's methods,

I was substantially, profoundly relieved from my **suffering**.

Why? Because I started to implement this practice

based on patichasam upada,

the **process of becoming**,

to create a different type of **being**,

of **being** with **integrity** engineered in from the start.

So this would not have happened

if I had not been dumped into this crisis.

And if we look at the stories of many prominent people,

people who have made tremendous contributions

to human society or business or knowledge,

or even spiritual life,

they all had this kind of an crisis, existential crisis. The Buddha did, the Buddha's story,

if you don't know, he was raised in fantastic opulence.

Everything that he wanted, whatever he wanted, he got. He had tremendous, not only material opulence,

but the people around him were very intelligent, very advanced.

But he was shielded from all **suffering**.

He had no idea how most of us live.

And one day he went out with his chariot driver

and said, "I want to see what's out there.

"Show me around."

And they went into the town.

And he saw for the first time in his life,

someone stricken by poverty,

someone stricken by disease,

old age and death.

And the Buddha was moved by **compassion**. He said, "This is going on."

And the chariot driver said, "Yes, everybody has to face these things."

"Even me?" he said.

"Yes, even you."

So he went back deeply, profoundly shaken

to the core of his **being**. Everything he had experienced so far in life

was called into question.

It was a shattering experience for him.

And he resolved, "I'm going to fix this.

"I'm going to solve this problem of **suffering** for everyone."

What a great person.

So he went, and you know the rest of the story,

he meditated in the forest and so on for six or seven years.

And then he finally found the key to enlightenment.

So what was that key for Noble Truths?

And we've given you them already.

There is **suffering**.

There is a **cause of suffering**. There is a **cessation of suffering** and a **path** to that **cessation**.

We're trying to teach you this **path**.

But first you have to acknowledge that you are **suffering**. We can't get to the fourth Noble Truth until you admit

that the first one applies to you.

And we've given a whole background,

a whole series, actually several series

of analysis of the human condition.

And now we have shown the causality behind it,

the **dependent origination**, patichasamupada,

the **process of becoming**.

So the problem is, every one of us has been engaged

in a **process of becoming** for our whole life.

And now what we have got by that process is not at all satisfactory.

We're **suffering**.

So that means we don't really understand the process

or the **cause of suffering**.

Because if we did, we'd be able to fix it. That's why we're going into patichasamupada in so much detail

and drilling it and drilling it. You should also watch our other videos on the same subject

in the paritta series.

I'm going to put links to that on the bottom here. That you have to understand not only that you can change your **being**,

but how to change your **being** and more than that,

what you should change your **being** into. Otherwise you're going to wind up right back

in the same position again, **suffering**. If you do not start the **process of becoming**,

from knowledge, in other words, if you started from ignorance

of the **Four Noble Truths**, you're going to wind up in **suffering** again and again.

And there's no way out of it until you adopt the Buddha's knowledge

and the Buddha's process.

And the measure of how well you adopt that process is in the **Vinaya**,

the principles or **precepts** of Buddhism. There are other measures too, and we'll get into all that as we go on in the series.

But you can see the way that you wound up **being** is more or less accidental.

Your **being** is more or less a product of circumstances.

The school has pushed you in a certain direction of **being**. Your parents have pushed you in a certain direction of **being**. The media, the sports, the culture, the music, everything around you

has pushed you this way and that way according to their agendas,

the politics, the other students at school,

the people you grew up with, the music of your generation, whatever it is. All contains semantic elements that when you absorb them into your name and form,

your process of fabrication, you create a type of **being**.

And that type of **being** creates a particular kind of **suffering**.

So that's where you are. It doesn't matter whether you accept the norms of society or rebel against them. It doesn't matter whether you follow the program and the agenda at school or at work,

or whether you're against it.

It doesn't matter whether your rebellion is open or covert. It doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor, fat or thin or what you are. That **being** is conditioned and that conditioned **being** is going to cause **suffering**.

That's just the way it is.

You think nature is wonderful and beautiful?

No, nature is a trap.

Nature is a machine based on this **process of becoming**.

And you can just as easily become a dog in your next life,

or become a worm or a snake as you can become a demigod.

It just depends on how you play the system. If you engage with knowledge and determination,

remember the three factors of **becoming**.

Comma, your consciousness and your desire.

So if you use these things properly, if you use them well,

you can substantially increase your quality of **being**

in a relatively short amount of time.

And over a longer amount of time, like when you change bodies,

you can make tremendous strides in **being**.

So how you do that is dependent on your level of knowledge

and your level of skill in controlling your mind, controlling your senses and so forth.

We're giving you all the tools to do this.

Now it's up to you to get the motivation together.

And I'm suggesting that the best motivation is the knowledge that

you are sooner or later going to face an existential crisis.

The cauldron of **becoming**, the crucible of **being**. You're going to be put into a situation where you must change your **being**.

Well, death is the universal one, it happens to everybody.

But if you're more fortunate than that,

you will be plunged into this existential crisis while you're still young enough

and agile enough to really do something about it. If you wait until you're on your deathbed,

I think you're going to blow it.

It's too late. You've already pretty much signed up for your next embodiment.

And you're going to have to ride that one through to the end.

So this is the attitude of someone who has been a meditator, lifelong,

sadhuka, and practicing sadhu in the Buddha's _saṅgha_. That, okay, the _kamma_ for this body is already pretty much determined.

There's not a whole lot we can do to change that. I can't change this body into, let's say, a demigod body, a deva body.

I have to wait until it's time to change this body.

But there's a lot that I can do right now to prepare myself for a higher embodiment in the future,

or for even transcending embodiment entirely. This is all possible through the **process of becoming**,

through the proper application of the **Eightfold Path**.

So I hope you have a vision now of how this thing fits in your life,

and how you can utilize this process to gain unprecedented benefits.

I mean, how can I tell you? I started going to spiritual teachers when I was about 20, no, maybe 18.

I was reading.

When I was 20, I was actually going.

And I studied extensively and read widely. I got so many initiations into so many different types of meditation,

and I practiced them all.

And many of them, the ones that were bonafide,

I practiced until I got the result.

And I'm still doing that.

So I have been around the block with this spiritual stuff. Actually, you can't even call the process of the Buddha spiritual.

It applies to everything.

So I have the confidence from my, I'll admit, limited experience practicing the Buddha's method.

But I'm so impressed with the results that I've got,

that I'm willing to take a stand on it and make a commitment to it, become a monk,

and then teach others through these videos and encourage them to walk the same **path**. Because the results that you get, the results that I got,

were unprecedented compared to the other spiritual methods.

And remember, I was a disciple of a Vedic spiritual master for over 40 years. I went so deep into that teaching, I hit rock bottom,

and I unearthed the fundamental fabrication and its root.

And of course, the thing that was out of **integrity** about that,

was that they weren't saying it was a fabrication,

they were saying it's the absolute truth. However, the Buddha, when someone asked him,

"Is the eight-fold noble **path** a fabrication?"

He said, "Yes."

See, the Buddha is honest.

Yes, it's a fabrication.

But it's a fabrication that leads to the end of fabrication. It's a **process of becoming** that leads to the end of **becoming**. Not that you become a slave on an eternal treadmill

to some transcendent God in some faraway heaven

in some other dimension or something like that.

No, he's not trying to cheat you.

He's telling you the truth.

This is a fabrication. This eight-fold **path** is a process of **being**,

just like the one that got you into **suffering**.

But this one leads out of **suffering**,

and it leads to complete enlightenment and **cessation of suffering**.

So that's what we're offering here.

And I think if you actually try this method,

and we're going to go into the actual mechanics,

the specifics of the method in the following episodes, okay?

So if you get what we're talking about here,

and you try this method,

I think you'll be convinced very quickly

that we're on to something.

So please think this over carefully. Maybe review the video several times,

contemplate it,

and think about it. The **being** that you have got is more or less the product of circumstances.

You were thrown into this world and had a deal with it. You've done okay so far, but you can do lots and lots better.

And sooner or later, you're going to hit a rough patch,

whether it's at the time of death or before,

that is going to force you to have to change your **being**.

And how are you going to do that? Are you going to use the same old slap-dash method

that got you into trouble in the first place? Or are you going to take the time now to learn the Buddha's **path**

and have a chance to get completely free from **suffering** forever?

Forever.
