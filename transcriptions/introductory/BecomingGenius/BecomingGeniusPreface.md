_Namaste_ 🙏🏼

Today I want to begin the **introduction** to the **Matrix Learning** course. And I've already mentioned that one of the the first things we’re going to study in the course is the **meaning** and **definition** of **terms**.

Now, I know from experience, a lot of people are going to be wondering, ‘What does the meaning and definition of terms have to do with **learning**?’ And the answer is, **everything**—because learning is a form of **communication**, **and** a form of **becoming**.

The **communication** part of learning is to **define** what we are going to **become**. And the **becoming** part is to actually **apply** the knowledge that we received in the **communication**.

Say, for example, I want to be able to play music; I want to be able to play an **instrument**. So the first part of learning is to **receive communications** about music. What are **notes**? What are **measures**? What are **time signatures**? What are **keys, flats** and **sharps,** and so on? And then the **second** part of that is the actual **practice**, where we learn to actually **do** what we've been learning **about**.

Okay? Words are not things; words are **symbols** **about** things. Words are **abstractions**. They're just **sounds**; but they're sounds that have a **coded meaning**. And the meaning is simply whatever the society **agrees** that it is; the **consensus** of all the users of that language. So somehow or other, we have language.

And the **dictionary**, and the **definitions** in the dictionaries, are the **code** by which we encode and decode the symbols called words in order to **communicate** something. And then, once we have communicated it—whether rightly or wrongly—we base our thoughts, words and actions on those **definitions** as we have understood them.

And that, along with our **practice** of whatever kind of knowledge it is, leads to our **becoming**. Let's say I want to become a flute player, right? (Well, actually, I am a flute player…) But at first, I have to hear about it. Then I have to practice it. And slowly, slowly, I will **become** a flute player.

Now, that's just an example. The **real** purpose here is spiritual advancement: we want to **become** **enlightened**. Well, how you become enlightened, of course, is by **stopping** the process of becoming. But in order to **reach** that realization, there is a certain **process of becoming** that **leads** to it. And **that** is what is communicated in the various **scriptures** and **teachings**, and what is realized in the various **practices**, of all the different _yogas_ and different forms of Self-realization in the world.

So I'm going to read a quote from the Buddha just to underscore this—how important this is:

> “Insofar only, Ānanda, can one be born, or grow old, or die, pass away or reappear—insofar only as there is any **pathway** for **verbal expression**, insofar only as there is any pathway for **terminology**, insofar only as there is any pathway for **designation**, insofar only as the **range of wisdom**, insofar only is the round kept going for there to be a **designation** as a **this-ness**. That is to say, **name-and-form** together with **consciousness**.” — _Dīgha-nikāya, Mahānidānasutta_

This is deep, deep, deep, deep stuff. The Buddha was probably one of the greatest intellectuals who ever lived, and so his teaching is **extremely deep**—and for the beginner, almost incomprehensible. Why? Because they don't have the proper **definitions** for the **terms**. Duh!

So this is what we're going to be studying: How does **terminology**, name-and-form together with consciousness, lead to **becoming**? He says, “only insofar as there is a **channel** or a **pathway** for **verbal expression**, can one be **born** or **die**, can one come into the world and **become** whatever one wants to become.” This is how important verbal expression is; this is how important name-and-form is.

Name-and-form causes what we call a **vortex**. Name-and-form creates consciousness; consciousness creates name-and-form. And they keep going around and around, and that is what is known as a **vortex**, or what Buddha calls in this verse a **this-ness**: a something, a thing, a **location** where something exists or is going on.

So what is the vortex in terms of **verbal expression**? Well, it's the **matrix**. That's why we call it **Matrix Learning**. The matrix is a network of **terminology** that are defined in terms of each other.

Try to understand: if we have a language which is full of **words**—right?—we have to define the words in terms of that **language**. And of course, we can only define them in terms of the **other** words in the language, so that they're understandable. So that becomes a circular process where one word is defined in terms of **other** words, which are defined in terms of **other** words, which are defined in terms of **that** word, and round-and-round it goes. But the point is, you have to be able to **explain** the meaning of any word in order to **understand** its **significance**, in order to **communicate** important **data**, in order to **transfer** **knowledge** and **skill** from one person to another.

So here we're dealing with the all-important skill of **Self-realization**. So we want to create a **matrix**, also known as an **ontology**, which is a **network of terminology** that gives a certain **background understanding** for the definition of **terms** in our discussion.

So our whole point, our whole focus, our whole effort here in this course, is to **discern** and **explain** how this process takes place, and **then** give a number of practical examples, so you can experience it for yourself: in other words, **realize** it.

So I'm going to go on and read some more from my Buddhist mentor, Ñānananda Bhikkhu:

> “There are a number of canonical passages that show us the relevance of this vortex simile to the understanding of _paṭicca-samuppāda_. In the _Mahānidānasutta_ of the _Dīgha-nikāya,_ we find a lengthy description of how the Bodhisatta Vipassī got an insight into _paṭicca-samuppāda_. We are told that his mode of approach was one of **radical reflection**, or _yoniso-manasikāra_, literally “attention by way of the **matrix**.” One might as well say that it is an attention by way of the **vortex**, because a matrix is a vortex.”

See, a matrix, an **ontology**—a group of words that are defined in terms of one another—is a **vortex**, because you're always going round and round and round in it, you see? And as long as you stay **within** the vortex, everything makes sense.

But of course, what we're trying to do in Self-realization is **escape** from the vortex, especially the vortex of birth-and-death, _saṁsāra_. So what we have to do before we can escape from it, is to **understand** it completely; \[because\] the reason that people get **caught up** in this consciousness and name-and-form is that they **don't** understand it.

They don't understand, for example, that because they don't have a proper **ontology** for the description of **consciousness**, for example, they are **trapped** by consciousness. They can't escape from consciousness—even during sleep, they're dreaming; or even in deep sleep, they're still conscious of nothing whatsoever.

So this **trap** has to be **understood**. Just like if you get caught in a hunter's trap in the forest—if you understand how it **works**, you can spring the trap and **escape**. But a poor animal who **can't** understand is **trapped**, and then the hunter comes and kills it.

So this is the situation in the **vortex of birth-and-death**. It is driven by **name-and-form** and **consciousness**, which create each other. Name-and-form creates consciousness; consciousness creates name-and-form.

For example, if a person doesn't understand the terminology relating to consciousness, they cannot **discern** that between the moments of waking consciousness and dreaming consciousness, there is a small moment of **transcendental consciousness** \[_turīya_\]. And likewise when they're coming the other way, out of dreams into waking.

So one must be extremely **astute** in the knowledge of the different categories of consciousness, even to **observe** this. This is what I mean when I say—as I do often—that people have spiritual experiences **all the time**, every day. But because they don't have adequate **terminology** and **understanding**, they don't **recognize** them. And those experiences, those **impressions**, are just thrown in the trash heap of neglected and denied experiences in the subconscious mind. Later it comes back to **bite** them.

So let me continue with this quote from Bhikkhu Ñānananda:

> “It is **clearly stated** in the case of Vipassī Bodhisatta, that his understanding through wisdom came as a result of **radical reflection**: _yoniso manasikārā ahu paññāya abhisamayo_. So his insight into _paṭicca-samuppāda_ was definitely **not** due to recollection of past lives. _Yoni_ literally means womb: the **matrix**, or the place of origin. So in _yoniso manasikāra_ always the attention has to **turn towards the place of origin**.” — _Nibbāna the Mind Stilled_, Sermon 3

Now, if you've been following this channel for more than a few days, you’ve heard me talk about _paṭicca-samuppāda. Paṭicca-samuppāda_ is the **core teaching** of the Buddha, and it describes the **process of becoming**; and it also describes the process of **getting out** of the trap of the **vortex** of becoming, and reaching _nibbāna_ or _nirvāṇa_.

The way you get out of the trap is by **undoing** it, one step at a time. So in order to even **perceive** those steps, you have to **master the terminology**. The terminology of the process of becoming is in the Buddha’s teaching of _paṭicca-samuppāda_.

Now Vipassī Buddha, while he was still a _bodhisattva_, before he attained enlightenment, inquired into this process of becoming through this **radical consciousness** or radical attention, this contemplation called _yoniso manasikāra_, where the consciousness always **turns toward the origin**.

So, what is the meaning of the **origin** in terms of **verbal descriptions**, terminology, and so forth? It is the **definitions**, because the definitions are giving the meanings that are transferred using the **code of language**.

So, just like **spies**, they're always using and trying to break codes. So the language is a **code**. It's a code for a certain **meaning**. And if you **know** the meaning, then you can **break** the code or **decipher** the code, and understand the meaning that's hidden in the words. Otherwise, it's just **sound**.

And people who, like, get **dissociated** because of drugs or whatever, sometimes **lose** the understanding of language. Why? Because they have **lost focus** on the **source**. They become **distracted** by the phenomenology of the **sounds**, and they forget that those sounds are meaningless unless they're **filtered** through a certain **matrix**, a certain **vortex of meaning**.

So, in this course, we are going to pick apart, analyze, and discuss this process of the **assigning of meaning to words**. That's actually just the **beginning** of it. And then there's **decoding** the words, and then there's **realizing** the words or actually **understanding**, in practical terms the meaning of the words, which leads to **realization**, which is also called **metacognition**.

And this is the **process of enlightenment**, the ulimate goal of all learning, and especially Matrix Learning or **Becoming Genius**.
