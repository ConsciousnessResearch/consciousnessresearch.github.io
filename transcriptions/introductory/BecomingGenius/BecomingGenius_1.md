## How to Learn

This video is about **how to learn skillfully:** the science of study.

If you **duplicate** and **apply** these methods in your study of **Skillful Living**, you will get much more out of the materials.

Most schooling deliberately teaches you the **wrong** way to learn. First, you should not approach a subject because **someone else** is making you study it; you should approach it because **you** want to learn it and put it into practical use in your life. In other words, you should **learn** to acquire **skills**.

The first necessary skill in the art of **Skillful Living** is **how to learn skillfully**.

## Presentation Design

The presentation design in an **informational** course is intended to leave you **informed**. The presentation design in **this** course is intended to open up a new world of **experience** for you: the experience of **Skillful Living** and specifically, the skill of being able to **teach yourself any skill** you desire. We use an unusual form of presentation to accomplish this.

We have developed **precise language** for the materials that experience and testing show we must make available to deliver **our promise** to you. Quite a bit of thought and testing has gone into the **language**: the **semantics** or the way things are stated.

On most of the slides, we will read the slide aloud while you read those same words silently to yourself. Please **read the slides to yourself** **at the same time you are listening to them being read**. From time to time, we will pause to **comment** on what has been read, **demonstrate** a technique, or have a discussion with you.

At any time, **if you do not understand a word that is used, or the meaning of what is read is not clear for you, please stop the video and look up the term in a good dictionary**. If you have a comment or question about what has been read, please **post** it in the comments.

One reason we use this form of presentation is to deal with the following problem: when we read a new or **counterintuitive** idea, often after we read all of the words in a passage, we have to go back and read it again to get **clear** on the meaning of what we read.

In fact, when reading **any** new material to ourselves, often we are not clear about the meaning of what is said in the **beginning** of a paragraph until we have read the **entire** paragraph. This even happens with sentences, where the meaning of the **beginning** of the sentence is sometimes not clear until we have read the **entire** sentence.

There are a **lot** of **new ideas** in **Skillful Living**. In these cases the **impact** of what was in the first few words of a sentence; the first few sentences in a paragraph; or the first few paragraphs in a section, is diminished.

The person reading this material out loud is **familiar** with the subject being presented. As a result, we can convey the meaning of what is being read through **tone of voice**, so it’s clear right from the beginning. In addition, because the meaning is being conveyed by the tone of the reader’s voice, hearing it **as it is meant** will help avoid misinterpreting the meaning of the material.

If you have had the experience of listening to an author reading from his or her own writing, you know that **that** experience is often much **richer** than when we read the same thing to ourselves.

Moreover, because you will also be reading the words to yourself as they are being read out loud, what is said comes into you through **two** senses: hearing and sight. The combination of reading when the meaning is clear from the beginning, and the use of two senses, results in a **clarity** and **impact** that is not available when reading something challenging for the first time by yourself.

We also intentionally employ a certain amount of **repetition**. We do this because as the course proceeds, and you master later material, reviewing what we covered earlier **deepens** the **meaning** and **impact** of that earlier material.

**art efficiency comparison listening vs reading while using Voice Reader**

When listening to text being read out loud while simultaneously reading it to yourself, there is a **44% increase** in comprehension efficiency over reading to yourself only. And in this study, this increase was produced by a **computer-generated** voice, that speaks with no **understanding** of what is being read, as contrasted with the way it will be read to you in **this** course.

With the combination of reading to yourself as we read out loud, and the other study techniques presented in this course, your comprehension of the material will **increase tremendously** over conventional study methods.

However: **at all times during this video if you hear a word you don’t know the meaning of, or you can’t follow something that’s said, stop the video and look up the words in a good dictionary. If necessary, post a query for clarification in the comments.**

If you don’t do this, there is a good chance that you will be unable to **apply** the material and will not be able to realize the **full benefits** of the course.

## Learning How to Learn

The most important and powerful thing that you can learn is **how to learn**. Once you know how to learn, you can **teach yourself** any skill you want to know. This video presents a simple method for teaching yourself **any** subject so that you can apply it **in practice** in your life.

**You would think** that the first thing they would teach you in school is **how to study**. How to learn stuff should be the **first** thing you learn; then once you know how to **learn**, you can **teach yourself** anything you want to know. If you think this makes **sense** (and it does), then you don’t understand how school **really** works.

Here’s the **truth**: the people who manage the educational system **don’t want** you to learn independently. They are more interested in **control** than imparting knowledge or skill. They deliberately make you **dependent** on the school system, so they can teach you what **they** want you to learn, and to keep you away from the subjects that they **don’t** want you to learn:

For example, the art and science of **Skillful Living**.

If you doubt this, then you should read up on [John Taylor Gatto](https://www.johntaylorgatto.com/), a really great teacher who was named a ’Teacher of the Year’ in the New York public school system **twice** in the 1990s.

Then they **fired** him, because he started telling everybody what was really going on behind the scenes; why our schools are such a **mess**, and why they **don’t really educate** their students—on purpose.

He is famous for claiming: “School is a 12-year jail sentence!”

Gatto revealed that **no** public school has classes or courses on how to study or how to learn; because their purpose is not to help you **learn**, it is to train you to be **obedient** to authority. He documents the design and development of the current educational system, and **proves** his points from the **actual writings** of the architects of the public school system. This isn’t **esoteric knowledge**: anyone can come to the same conclusions by simple observation and experience.

In fact, only the **very best** private schools, and colleges like Harvard, actually train their students in the scientific methods of **how to learn**. Those are the schools of the social and economic elite, so they **want** their kids to actually be smart—to actually be skillful—so the same families can continue their dominance of society.

It is assumed that **these** kids are motivated to be obedient to the system, because they have **so much to lose** if they aren’t. So the offspring of the **elites** are given the opportunity to actually become **wise**, if they so choose. Everyone else is deliberately kept **ignorant**, and manipulated through the media, financial controls and corporations.

By the way, being **wise** not only means knowing **how to learn**, it also means knowing **how to** **think** for yourself. Most people simply form **opinions** based on whether they like or dislike something. **Thinking** is a higher-level skill. Knowing how to learn comes first, because you have to know how to learn before you can teach yourself **how to think**. And you have to **teach yourself** how to think, because the very nature of thinking for yourself means that it is one of those things in life that **nobody** can teach you—you have to figure it out **independently**. That’s another reason you need to learn **how to learn**.

With the simple method we present here, you can teach yourself **any subject** or skill. Not just the **theory** or words about the subject, but a skilled level of **practical application**. If you apply this method consistently, you **will** get the result. It may seem dry and boring at first, or too plodding and intellectual.

But let’s say it again: if you use the Skillful Living **science of study** method, you can teach yourself **any skill**. **Any** subject or skill at all!

Think about it—what would you **like** to be able to do, but cannot **learn** to do at your present level of skill?

Of course, we would suggest that you use the science of study method to understand and teach yourself **Skillful Living**. But, you get my point: just on **general principles**, **everybody** should learn how to learn, so they can **teach themselves** any skill they want

The science of study self-learning method has three main parts:

- Putting things in context.
- Clearing misunderstood terms.
- Modeling relationships and functions.

Now we will discuss each of these parts, beginning with putting things in context.

## Foreground and Background

The proper context is a **requirement** for consciousness or awareness of **anything**. For example, we will not be aware of a black cat on a black rug in a black room with the lights off at midnight. The same cat is **easily** visible on a white rug in a white room at noon on a sunny day.

So everything has a proper **context**, and this context is the **key** to its real **meaning**. Every word, symbol, picture, sound, gesture, facial expression, experience, action, perception, sentence, discussion, feeling, idea and intention **exists in some context**. When we hold it in the **wrong** context, we miss the **real meaning** and become confused or frustrated. When we hold it in the **right** context, we **see** the real meaning and have an “Aha!” moment—a moment of **insight** into reality.

For example, **everyone** has an experience of school. if we try to hold that experience in the context of **learning**, it doesn’t make sense, and we feel confused and frustrated. But once we read or hear John Taylor Gatto, we get that we should actually hold our experience of school in the context of a **social control mechanism**. Aha! **Now** it all makes sense, and we can understand that if we want to become wise, we have to **take responsibility** for our own education.

Similarly, if we try to hold our **experience of life** in the context of the ordinary materialistic understanding, it doesn’t make sense, and we feel confused and frustrated. But if we hold life in the context of **Skillful Living**, we will have not one, but **many** “Aha!” experiences as we get insights into the **real meaning** of our existence and activities.

Similarly, **all** learning should be held in the context of **acquiring a skill**. Acquiring skillfulness is **also** a skill in itself.

When we want to read a book, we hold it up to the light. Why? Because we can’t read in the dark; we need the **context** of light to see the page. Similarly, if we are having trouble understanding or **applying** a subject, it is because we are holding it, or parts or pieces of it, in the **wrong context**, or in the wrong relationship to the other parts.

Finding the right context is both a **science** and an **art**. The subject of **context** will come up again and again as we go through the materials on **Skillful Living**. If you already can sense its importance and want some advanced training, we will have links later on to our **source materials**. But **everyone** can understand the difference between foreground and background, **content** and **context**. If you can’t get something, then try putting it in **another context**.

So, here is the first principle of the Science of Learning:

**art if you feel confused**

The rest of this video gives some practical tips on how to resolve contextual problems while studying. Knowledge of Skillful Living is very scientific and precise. To transfer this knowledge to **you**, we must find a way to define and communicate **precise concepts**. So the first area of content and context is in the **definitions of terms**.

## Misunderstood Terminology

Each and every letter, word, symbol, figure—even the graphical layout of a text—has a **specific meaning** and **definition**. If you cannot **quote** the definition, you **don’t know** the meaning of the terminology. In other words, you’re **guessing**—and will probably get it wrong.

Misunderstood terminology can **stop** you from getting the sense of a subject, and **distract** you from learning how to apply it skillfully. In fact, **the main reason a student becomes discouraged and gives up the study of a skill is because of misunderstood terms**.

**Misunderstood** terms are different from **not-understood** terms. Everyone knows when they see a math equation or a big word like ’antidisestablishmentarianism’, that they **don’t** understand it. Then they can look up the definition in a dictionary or search engine.

But, when we **think** that we understand the meaning of a word or symbol, but actually **don’t**, then we’re in **trouble** because we will sail right on by it without recognizing that we got it **wrong**. This is the definition of a **misunderstood term**.

Much of the terminology used in the expert-level material on any subject—including **Skillful Living**—is extremely specialized, scientific or technical. Terms originating in other languages and cultures may have **no** direct English equivalent. Some terms used in the study of **Skillful Living** are so **laden** with **significance** that an elaborate discussion with intricate logic is required to define and understand them to the point where you can **apply** them skillfully.

But most technical terms are **easily recognized** as **not-understood terms**, so they are easy to notice and get cleared up. Most **misunderstood** terms are **simple words** that specify relationship: such as _and, thus, if, such, that, which, up, though_ and so forth. We **think** that we know what these words mean, but on close examination we will find that our concept of their meaning is so **vague** that we cannot **define** them coherently. These **small relationship words** are the most commonly **misunderstood terms**.

## Symptoms of Misunderstood Terms

The main symptom of misunderstood terminology is that **one is unable to skillfully apply the subject or information one is studying**.

Other symptoms of misunderstood terms include degradation of **consciousness** or loss of **comprehension**; you feel that the information you are studying makes no **sense**; forgetfulness, short-term **memory loss**, or loss of comprehension of material immediately after it is presented or read. You may also feel tired, sleepy, yawning, distracted, dreamy, dizzy, spinny, lightheaded, tense, short of breath, intoxicated, introverted, fearful, panicky, paranoid, angry, belligerent or rebellious when there is **no real reason** to feel that way.

You may have **eye** trouble: the page appears to go **blank**, or looks **dark**; you feel like something is in your eyes, or see shadows moving in your peripheral vision. You may have a **strong irrational urge** to disrupt the class, **interrupt** your study, close the book or escape from the classroom or other learning environment. Some people may desire to project their **irrelevant personal opinions** or **negative emotional reactions** onto the material, the presenter or the teacher.

All these symptoms have one and the same cause: **you have encountered a misunderstood term or symbol and gone past it without getting it properly defined**.

## Finding Misunderstood Terms

When you are trying to learn something and you observe the **symptoms** of misunderstood terms, **stop**. First realize the **actual** **cause** of the symptoms, then **go back**, and **find** your misunderstood terms, so you can look them up and **clear** them.

The misunderstood terms will always be **before** the point where you experience the symptoms. Go **back** to where you were doing OK and understand everything clearly. Then go through the material very carefully—word-by-word, until you find a term that you **cannot define**. **That** is your misunderstood term. There may be more than one. Note down your misunderstood terms so you can methodically **clear** them.

## Clearing misunderstood terms

- **Look up the term** in a good dictionary, encyclopedia, technical manual or original source where you can find a good definition.
- **Scan through the definitions** until you find the **exact definition** that applies in the **context** where the term is used.
- **Make up several original sentences** using the term in the **exact definition** found in the original context.
- If the **definition** includes **other** terms that are misunderstood, **look those up too**, until you are **absolutely clear** on the definitions of **all** terms.

Now, let’s go through a **demonstration** of how to clear a misunderstood term, using this same screen that we were looking at a minute ago.

Let’s say, I want to look up the term **up**. I don’t know what it means there. Can I quote the definition? “Look **up.”** Well, mmm, kind of vague isn’t it?

So, let’s use the **Writing Tools**. Look up in Dictionary the word **up**. What does it mean in **this context**? “Toward the sky or a higher position”? I don’t think so. “To the place where someone is”? Well, no. “At or to a higher level of intensity, volume or activity”? Maybe. “Into the desired or a **proper condition**.” Ah, that sounds pretty good; let’s let’s look at the other ones to make sure. “Into a happy mood”? No. “Displayed on a bulletin board or other…”? No, “Of sailing against the current or the wind; (baseball) at bat; from a lower or higher to a higher point”? No, it’s definitely an adverb because it’s in conjunction with the word **look**, which is a verb. So we’re going to **look** “into the desired or proper condition” the term. OK? “Look **up** the term.”

Here’s an original sentence: “Fill **up** the tank with gas. Beam me **up**, Scotty.” That’s not very original; but that’ll do to show how we make up a sentence. And are there any **other** terms in this definition that are misunderstood? Well, I’m sure we could find some, but not right now. So that’s it; that’s how you look up a misunderstood term.

## Science of Study Benefits

If you go through this Science of Study carefully, and apply it in your own study, you will notice a **sharp increase** in your comprehension—especially in your ability to **apply** the materials skillfully. **Clearing misunderstood terms** may go slowly in the beginning; but before long, your reading speed will increase beyond anything you thought possible.

In our experience, full comprehension of, and ability to apply the **Skillful Living** materials depends on your using the techniques in this video. Don’t believe me, but take some time to experiment with our methods, and **experience** their benefits for **yourself**!
