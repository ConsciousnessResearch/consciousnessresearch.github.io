**Consciousness Research Centre** — *A Living Archive of Vedic and Buddhist Wisdom*

Exploring Vedic philosophy, spiritual practice, and Self-realization through accessible insights and timeless teachings.

For over 13 years, Consciousness Research Centre has presented a postgraduate-level seminar on spiritual philosophy and practice — over 2,000 video talks exploring the Upaniṣads, the Buddha’s teachings, yoga, tantra, astrology, and lived experience of the Self.

This archive is guided by a simple vow: everything taught here has been personally studied, practiced and realized. Each talk is both commentary and testimony, linking original sources of Vedic and Buddhist traditions with the challenges of contemporary life.

The project continues to grow as a freely available library of wisdom — a path for seekers, students, and researchers who wish to discover not only what the scriptures say, but how their truths can be lived today.
