# Welcome to the Consciousness Research Centre

A living archive of Vedic philosophy, spiritual practice, and reflections on the Self.

For over thirteen years, this project has provided postgraduate-level seminars exploring the Upaniṣads, the Buddha’s teachings, yoga, tantra, astrology, and lived experience of the Self. Nothing here is taught that has not been personally practiced or realized.
